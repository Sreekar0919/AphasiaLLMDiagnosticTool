        "6. Determine a score based on the the following studies: The WAB has four subdomains: (1) spontaneous speech; (2) auditory comprehension; (3) repetition; and (4) naming designed to determine the presence of aphasia and judge the type of linguistic deficit and measure the severity of language impairment. The full score of spontaneous speech is 20, including fluency and content of information. The 200 points of auditory comprehension consist of 60 points of Yes–No questions, 60 points of auditory word recognition, and 80 points of sequential commands. The total score of repetition is 100. A total of 100 points are given for naming, including 60 points for object naming, 20 points for fluency of words, 10 points for sentence completion, and 10 points for responsive speech. The calculation formula of the aphasia quotient is “AQ = (Spontaneous + Comprehension ÷ 20 + Repetition ÷ 10 + Naming ÷ 10) × 2”. All of the items result in a range of possible scores from 0 to 100. Combined with the clinical data of stroke patients, those whose aphasia quotient is less than 93.8 can be judged as aphasia, and the smaller the aphasia quotient, the more serious the aphasia. In addition, the WAB-AQ is commonly used to measure recovery, although there is a discrepancy between clinical impression and WAB in the classification of aphasia, the superiority of WAB is that it can quantify language damage.\n",

        "Aphasia is a disorder that results from damage to portions of the brain that are responsible for language. For most people, these areas are on the left side of the brain. Aphasia usually occurs suddenly, often following a stroke or head injury, but it may also develop slowly, as the result of a brain tumor or a progressive neurological disease. The disorder impairs the expression and understanding of language as well as reading and writing. Aphasia may co-occur with speech disorders, such as dysarthria or apraxia of speech, which also result from brain damage.\n",
        "\n",
        "Who can acquire aphasia?\n",
        "Most people who have aphasia are middle-aged or older, but anyone can acquire it, including young children. About 1 million people in the United States currently have aphasia, and nearly 180,000 Americans acquire it each year, according to the National Aphasia Association.\n",
        "\n",
        "What causes aphasia?\n",
        "Aphasia is caused by damage to one or more of the language areas of the brain. Most often, the cause of the brain injury is a stroke. A stroke occurs when a blood clot or a leaking or burst vessel cuts off blood flow to part of the brain. Brain cells die when they do not receive their normal supply of blood, which carries oxygen and important nutrients. Other causes of brain injury are severe blows to the head, brain tumors, gunshot wounds, brain infections, and progressive neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.\n",
